Piranha.Entities
================
This is the Entity Framework 4 mapping of the Piranha core. This project is
ongoing and to be included in the core library in a future version. The names
of the tables and columns differs from the ones in the core database, so this
library can't be used as en EF entrypoint to the current Piranha Core at this
stage.

If you have solid experience in Entity Framwork and want to contribute in
porting the Piranha Core application don't hesitate to contact me.
