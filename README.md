Piranha.Entities
================
This is the Entity Framework 4 mapping of the Piranha core entities. For now
these projects are totally separate and can be used side by side. Eventually 
this library will be used by the core instead of the current ActiveRecord 
implementation.

The current version of Piranha is 1.0 and the application template can be
downloaded using NuGet. For more information, please refer to the documentation
on our official site.
